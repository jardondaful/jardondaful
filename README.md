## About Me

Hello there! 👋 I'm Jordan Lin, a UCLA graduate who recently completed a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering and minoring in Geospatial Information Systems and Technologies. My academic and professional journey is driven by my passion for creating user-centered software. My professional experience includes roles at both Esri and UCLA, where I fulfilled four internships and part-time positions in technical support and software/website development. I have thoroughly enjoyed learning how to apply my technical skill set in a variety of professional environments and am always eager to take on new challenges. Dive in to discover how I blend analytical skills with technological artistry to navigate and shape the digital landscape🎓🚀.

## Personal/Team Projects (Language(s)/Framework)

## GIS Projects (ArcGIS Online Username: jlin_181Bsum22)
- 🗺️ **Mapping Vernal Swale Italian Thistle Invasion (Agisoft Metashape, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Field Maps, GRASS GIS)**: Employed advanced aerial imaging techniques to survey the Vernal Swale at UC Sedgwick Reserve, leveraging cutting-edge technology including a DJI Mavic 3 M drone equipped with an RTK receiver. Our focus was on meticulously mapping the distribution of the invasive Italian Thistle. By meticulously processing and analyzing UAV imagery using Agisoft Metashape, we gained invaluable insights. Further enhancing our assessment, we utilized the robust capabilities of ArcGIS Pro and GRASS GIS to predict and visualize the spread of Italian Thistle in the Vernal Swale, contributing significantly to ecological impact assessment.
