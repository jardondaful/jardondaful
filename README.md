## About Me

Hello there! 👋 I'm Jordan Lin, a student at UCLA pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering and minoring in Geospatial Information Systems and Technologies. My academic and professional journey is driven by a passion for solving complex problems through innovative technology solutions. 🎓🚀

I've engaged in a variety of projects that span dynamic UI development, backend automation, and comprehensive GIS analyses. My roles as a Software Development Intern at Esri and a Part-Time UI/UX Designer & Website Developer at UCLA's Asian American Studies Center have sharpened my skills in frontend development, UX design, and system automation. 🌐💡

I am dedicated to leveraging my technical expertise to develop accessible, engaging, and efficient solutions for real-world challenges, always seeking opportunities for learning and growth. 🌟📚

## Personal/Team Projects (Language(s)/Framework)

- 🍔 **Bruin Bites (JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, Firebase)**: Engineered a dynamic user profile system for UCLA students to share dining preferences and reviews. Developed a system integrated with GIS mapping to visualize dining preferences across UCLA, leveraging geospatial data for an enhanced user experience.

- 💬 **Twitch Bot (Twitch API, OAuth, Node.js)**: Combined the Twitch API with OAuth to automate viewer experience enhancement and request fulfillment. Utilized asynchronous code to execute up to 5+ commands simultaneously.

- 🖨️ **DMA Printlab Status Interface (Python, Flask, Ansible, YAML, SQL, React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS)**: Streamlined data retrieval from 100+ machines at UCLA's DMA Printlab. Developed a web interface for effective machine status and statistics display.

- 🚶‍♂️ **TrailMatch (React, Natural Language Processing API, ArcGIS Online, Figma)**: As a Software Developer, GIS Analyst, and UI/UX Designer, I integrated Natural Language Processing API with ArcGIS products and React.js for dynamic hiking trail recommendations based on live data. I automated 3D visualization of trail features, such as nearby gas stations and the amount of sunshine, enhancing user engagement.

- 🚌 **Bruin Bus Route/Stop Locator (ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, Python)**: Optimized Los Angeles bus route selection using Python and GTFS data, improving UCLA student travel efficiency. Automated the production of visual route guides and schedules for better navigation in Los Angeles.
