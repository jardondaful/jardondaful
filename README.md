## About Me

Hello there! 👋 I'm Jordan Lin, currently a student at UCLA, where I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering with a minor in Geospatial Information Systems and Technologies. My journey through academia and professional experiences has been driven by a passion for solving complex problems through innovative technology solutions. 🎓🚀

Since embarking on my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, from developing dynamic user interfaces to automating backend processes and engaging in comprehensive GIS analyses. My experiences as a Software Development Intern at Esri and a Part-Time UI/UX Designer & Website Developer at UCLA's Asian American Studies Center have allowed me to refine my skills in frontend development, UX design, and system automation. 🌐💡

My work, including significant projects like "Mapping Vernal Swale Italian Thistle Invasion" and "TrailMatch," showcases my ability to blend software development with GIS technology, creating impactful solutions that enhance user engagement and environmental analysis. 🗺️💼

I'm deeply committed to leveraging my technical expertise to create accessible, engaging, and efficient solutions for real-world challenges. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to learn and grow, whether through hands-on projects, collaborative teamwork, or continuous education. 🌟📚
