## About Me

Hello there! 👋 I'm Jordan Lin, a UCLA graduate who recently completed a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering and minoring in Geospatial Information Systems and Technologies. My academic and professional journey is driven by my passion for creating user-centered software. My professional experience includes roles at both Esri and UCLA, where I fulfilled four internships and part-time positions in technical support and software/website development. I have thoroughly enjoyed learning how to apply my technical skill set in a variety of professional environments and am always eager to take on new challenges. Dive in to discover how I blend analytical skills with technological artistry to navigate and shape the digital landscape🎓🚀.
